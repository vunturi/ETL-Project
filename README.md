# SuperDuberProject
For this ETL project, we are analyzing two datasets to see if we can find a correlation between the overall happiness of a country, and the amount of Starbucks coffee shops located in that country. We chose this because we were curious to see if the avaliability of a reliable source of caffeine within a country, and the sense of community provided by the largest coffee brand in the world, could visibly show a pattern in the happiness the people of that country have.
